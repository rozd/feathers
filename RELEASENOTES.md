# Feathers Release Notes

Noteworthy changes in official, stable releases of [Feathers](http://feathersui.com/).

## 2.0.0

* New style provider architecture for skinning and themes.
* Components may always be validated, even if they are not on the display list yet.
* New Text Editor: TextBlockTextEditor is a desktop-only text editor built on FTE, similar to TextBlockTextRenderer.
* New Text Editor: BitmapFontTextEditor is a desktop-only text editor built on bitmap fonts, similar to BitmapFontTextRenderer.
* All Components: subComponentProperties pattern is now stricter. If properties that don't exist are set, a runtime error will be thrown.
* BitmapFontTextRenderer: properly redraws when isEnabled is changed.
* BitmapFontTextRenderer: if textFormat is null, generates a default value so that something will be displayed (using Starling's embedded BitmapFont.MINI).
* Button: added minGap property that is used when gap is set to Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY.
* Button: pulled out toggle functionality into a subclass: ToggleButton.
* Button: removed now-useless autoFlatten property.
* Button: added new hasLabelTextRenderer that may be set to false to avoid creating the text renderer (for things like scroll bar or slider button sub-components).
* Button: fixed issue where button didn't return to up state when focus is changed with keyboard while in another state.
* Callout: added stagePadding property to set stagePaddingTop, stagePaddingRight, stagePaddingBottom, and stagePaddingLeft properties all at once.
* Callout: fixed issue where touch listener was removed when callout was removed, but it wasn't re-added when the same callout instance was shown again.
* DefaultGroupedListHeaderOrFooterRenderer: fixed issue where content wasn't disabled when isEnabled changed.
* Drawers: added optional overlaySkin property to fade in a display object over the content when a drawer is opened.
* Drawers: checks if event types are null before adding listeners.
* Drawers: open and close events now pass the display object in the event data.
* Drawers: fix for issue where wrong toggle duration may used sometimes.
* DropDownPopUpContentManager: added new gap property.
* FeathersControl: enforced as an abstract class. If you need a generic Feathers component wrapper for layoutData and things, use LayoutGroup.
* FeathersControl: added styleName and styleNameList property to replace nameList. The name property is no longer used for styling, and it will work for getChildByName() in the rare situations where it was broken. The nameList property is deprecated.
* FeathersControl: fixed issue where changing minTouchWidth or minTouchHeight did not update the hit area if the width or height wasn't changed at the same time.
* FeathersControl: fixed issue where component would validate when disposed.
* FeathersControl: fixed issue in setSize() where scaled dimensions weren't updated.
* FocusManager: support for custom IFocusManager instances and support for multiple Starling stages.
* FocusManager: fixed issue where disabled components could receive focus.
* Header: added useExtraPaddingForOSStatusBar property to support iOS 7 status bar behavior.
* Header: getters for leftItems, rightItems, and centerItems no longer duplicate the array.
* Header: now disposed leftItems, rightItems, and centerItems by default. Can be controlled with new disposeItems property.
* Header: fixed issue where title text renderer's isEnabled property wasn't properly updated.
* Header: fixed issue where the touchable property was incorrectly set to false on some children.
* IFocusDisplayObject: added new focusOwner property to allow pop-ups to be owned by another component. Allows the focus manager to manage focus order better with components like PickerList.
* ImageLoader: checks for lost context before creating a texture from a loaded URL.
* ImageLoader: fixed issue where isLoaded getter didn't always return true if the source is a texture.
* ImageLoader: fixed issue where loaded textures could be uploaded to wrong Starling instance if multiple Starling instances were active.
* Item Renderers: added skinField, skinFunction, and itemHasSkin for background skins from the data provider.
* Item Renderers: added isSelectableOnAccessoryTouch property to control whether the selection will change or not when the accessory is touched.
* Item Renderers: added minGap and minAccessoryGap properties that are used when gap or accessoryGap are set to Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY.
* ITextEditor, ITextRenderer: extend a new IBaselineTextControl interface that defines a common baseline property.
* Layouts: fixed issue where they didn't account for pivotX and pivotY.
* Layouts: when centering items, rounds the x and y positions to the nearest integer.
* LayoutGroup: added new backgroundSkin and backgroundDisabledSkin properties.
* List, GroupedList: if dataProvider property is changed, or the collection dispatches CollectionEventType.RESET, automatically behaves as if updateItemAt() were called on all item renderers.
* ListCollection, HierarchicalCollection: added dispose() function to support a way to dispose things like display objects or textures in items.
* NumericStepper: claims exclusive touch so that it won't repeat while scrolling with touch.
* NumericStepper: fixes for obscure situations where text input changes are not reflected in the value.
* NumericStepper: improved auto-measurement for values that are not integers.
* NumericStepper: added textInputGap and buttonGap properties.
* PageIndicator: added new interactionMode property to allow alternate precise selection of symbols on tap, instead of previous back/next behavior.
* Panel: added new outerPadding properties to support padding that is around the everything, including the header and footer. The existing (inner) padding properties only apply to the content between the header and footer.
* PanelScreen: turns on clipping by default.
* PickerList: added toggleButtonOnOpenAndClose property.
* PickerList: implements IFocusDisplayObject and manages focus of children better.
* PickerList: closes on enter key to match native behavior.
* PopUpManager: when centering a pop-up, rounds the x and y positions to the nearest integer.
* ProgressBar: fixed vertical fill so that it starts from the bottom and fills up.
* PropertyProxy: added toString() function to allow a PropertyProxy to be output to console.
* Scale3Image, Scale9Image, fixed issue where scaling smaller than the minimum size would cause overlapping instead of distortion when end regions weren't the same size.
* Scale3Textures, Scale9Textures: fixed rendering of textures with a scale property that isn't equal to 1.
* Screens: removed dpiScale, pixelScale, originalWidth, and originalHeight properties. The kinds of calculations these values were used for should be handled in the theme (or somewhere else outside of the screen if not using a theme).
* ScrollBar: increment and decrement buttons are hidden, like the thumb, if the minimum is equal to the maximum. The track fills the full dimensions.
* ScrollBar: fix for wrongly positioned track when direction is horizontal.
* ScrollContainer: fixed wrong measurement when using no layout with children at negative coordinates.
* Scroller: fixed issue where a floating scroll bar wouldn't disappear.
* Scroller: refactored scrolling behavior to more closely match iOS native scrolling.
* Scroller: touch overlay and background skins are added and removed instead of changing visible property. Works better with Monster Debugger.
* Scroller: fixes issue where events were dispatched for a completed scroll when the scroll position didn't actually change from calling throwTo().
* Scroller: added support for a view port that doesn't necessarily auto-size to show its full content. In other words, a view port can choose to measure so that it needs to scroll.
* Scroller: fixed issue where background wasn't sized property when isEnabled was changed.
* Scroller: skips some unnecessary code when dimensions are explicit to improve performance.
* Scroller: added new measureViewPort property that can be set to false to exclude the view port from auto-measurement and only use the background skin.
* Scroller: automatically sets direction property on scroll bars, so that you don't need to, thanks to the new IDirectionalScrollBar interface.
* ScrollText: added disabledTextFormat property.
* ScrollText: may receive focus and use keyboard arrow keys to scroll.
* Slider: added new trackInteractionMode property to control whether touching the track updates the value by page or jumps directly to the nearest value.
* SmartDisplayObjectValueSelector: fixed issue where getValueTypeHandler() function had an extra parameter.
* SmartDisplayObjectValueSelector: added support for null value other than the default.
* SmartDisplayObjectValueSelector: stricter reuse of display objects. Type must match exactly. Fixes issue where Image is incorrectly reused because it is a subclass of Quad.
* StageTextTextEditor: fixed issue where measurement was wrong when text was an empty string.
* StageTextTextEditor: fixed issue on iOS where characters were masked immediately instead of showing in the clear for a moment.
* StageTextTextEditor: fixed issue where the clipboard menu appeared unexpectedly when multiline is true.
* StageTextTextEditor: draws StageText to BitmapData with double dimensions on Mac HiDPI, thanks to Adobe's bug fix.
* TabBarSlideTransitionManager: fixes bug where switching between tabs quickly would break the transition.
* Text: will use non-power-of-two textures for snapshots, if the Stage 3D profile supports it.
* Text: if a renderer or editor supports native filters, does some extra cleanup in dispose() that is actually unnecessary, but will ease some pressure if there's a memory leak.
* Text: fixed issue where snapshot wasn't updated when isEnabled changed.
* TextBlockTextRenderer: if elementFormat is null, generates a default value so that something will be displayed.
* TextBlockTextRenderer: fixed issue where width was calculated wrong when text ended in whitespace.
* TextFieldTextEditor, TextFieldTextRenderer: added useGutter property to allow removal of the 2-pixel "gutter" that Flash adds to a TextField.
* TextInput, TextArea: added hasFocus getter to allow checking focus, even if there is no focus manager.
* TextInput, Text Editors: added new selectionBeginIndex and selectionEndIndex properties.
* TextInput: fixes issue where prompt text renderer's isEnabled property wasn't updated.
* TextInput: added new verticalAlign property to support top, middle, bottom, or justify.
* TextInput: won't throw an error if there's no background skin, but auto-measurement will result in a width and height of 0, unless typicalText is set.
* TextInput: improved support for text editors that are completely on the Starling display list without a native overlay.
* TextInput: doesn't create prompt text renderer if prompt is null.
* TextArea: added stateToSkinFunction, similar to Button background skin.
* TextArea: fixed issue where background skin was sometimes missing.
* TextArea: added clearFocus() function match API of TextInput.
* TextArea: further improvements to positioning and scaling of texture snapshot.
* Text Editors: improved support for Mac HiDPI.
* Text Editors: added disabled font styles.
* Text Renderers: uses generateFilterRect() when using nativeFilters for improved texture dimensions.
* Text Renderers: ITextRenderer now has a first-class wordWrap property that is required by all renderers.
* TiledColumnsLayout, TiledRowsLayouts: fixed result of getScrollPositionForIndex() when paging is disable to allow the item to be properly centered.
* TiledColumnsLayout, TiledRowsLayouts: fixed calculation of tile count when padding is used.
* TiledColumnsLayout, TiledRowsLayout: added requestedRowCount and requestedColumnCount properties.
* ToggleSwitch: fixed issue where the isEnabled property of text renderers wasn't properly updated.
* ToggleSwitch: added toggleThumbSelection property to update the isSelected property of the thumb (if it's a ToggleButton) to match the isSelected property of the switch.
* ToggleSwitch: fixed issue where selection change wasn't animated when triggered with the keyboard instead of a touch.
* ToggleSwitch: added new setSelectionWithAnimation() method so that programmatic selection changes can be optionally animated.
* Examples: override initialize() instead of listening for FeathersEventType.INITIALIZE.
* Example Themes: rewritten using the new style provider system.
* Example Themes: tweaked padding, gap, dimensions, and other values to be based on a simple grid system for more consistency.

### 2.0.0 Deprecated APIs

All deprecated APIs are subject to the [Feathers deprecation policy](http://wiki.starling-framework.org/feathers/deprecation-policy). Please migrate to the new APIs as soon as possible because the deprecated APIs **will** be removed in a future version of Feathers.

The `nameList` property has been deprecated, and it is replaced by the `styleNameList` property. The `name` property is no longer connected to style names, and situations where it failed to work with `getChildByName()` have been resolved. The `styleName` property has been added to replace the former usage of the `name` property as a concatenated version of `nameList` (now, `styleNameList`).

The `manageVisibility` property on layouts has been deprecated. In previous versions, this property could be used to improve performance of non-virtual layouts by hiding items that were outside the view port. However, other performance improvements have made it so that setting `manageVisibility` can now sometimes hurt performance instead of improving it.

### 2.0.0 Default Behavior and API Changes

This is a major update to Feathers, so it includes more breaking changes than usual. Be sure to read this section thoroughly to see if any of these changes will affect your apps.

`TextFieldTextRenderer` and `TextFieldTextEditor` now have a `useGutter` property that controls whether the 2-pixel gutter around the edges of the `flash.text.TextField` will be used in measurement and layout. In previous versions of Feathers, the gutter was always enabled. The gutter is now disabled by default to allow text controls based on `TextField` to more easily align with other text controls.

The `ITextRenderer` and `ITextEditor` interfaces now extend the `ITextBaselineControl` interface. In the case of `ITextEditor`, a new `baseline` getter is required.

The `ITextRenderer` interface now requires a `wordWrap` property.

The `IFocusDisplayObject` interface now requires a `focusOwner` property.

Properties including `dpiScale`, `pixelScale`, `originalWidth`, `originalHeight`, and `originalDPI` have been removed from `Screen`, `ScrollScreen` and `PanelScreen`. The calculations previously offered by these properties should be handled in skinning code, such as the theme.

The `Button` class no longer supports selection. This functionality has been moved into a subclass, `ToggleButton`.

The `autoFlatten` property has been removed from the `Button` class.

Setting the properties of a sub-component, such as using `thumbProperties` on a `Slider` to set properties on the slider's thumb sub-component, is now stricter. Previously, when a property did not exist, it was silently ignored. Now, an error will be thrown.

If no text format is defined, `BitmapFontTextRenderer` defaults to using `BitmapFont.MINI` so that the text will always be rendered. Previously, it would render nothing.

If no element format is defined, `TextBlockTextRenderer` defaults to using a new `ElementFormat` with default arguments so that the text will always be rendered. Previously, an error was thrown.

A `trackInteractionMode` property has been added to `Slider`. In previous versions, `Slider` behaved as if `trackInteractionMode` were set to `Slider.TRACK_INTERACTION_MODE_BY_PAGE`. Now, the default value is `Slider.TRACK_INTERACTION_MODE_TO_VALUE`.

A `verticalAlign` property has been added to `TextInput`. In previous versions, `TextInput` behaved as if `verticalAlign` were set to `TextInput.VERTICAL_ALIGN_JUSTIFY`. Now, the default value is `TextInput.VERTICAL_ALIGN_MIDDLE`.

The `FeathersControl` class is now considered abstract. It will throw a runtime error if instantiated directly instead of being subclassed. If you need a generic Feathers component as a wrapper for another display object, use `LayoutGroup` instead.

The `leftItems`, `rightItems`, and `centerItems` getters on the `Header` class no longer make a copy of their storage variables. Take care when modifying these values directly.

Focus management now supports multiple Starling stages (for AIR desktop apps). The static `isEnabled` property has been removed. Instead, you should use the static `setEnabledForStage()` function:

```as3
FocusManager.setEnabledForStage( Starling.current.stage, true );
```

All layouts now account for the `pivotX` and `pivotY` properties when positioning display objects. In previous versions, these properties were ignored.

When the `direction` property of a `ProgressBar` is equal to `ProgressBar.DIRECTION_VERTICAL`, the fill now starts at the bottom and fills up.

The increment button and decrement button sub-components of a `ScrollBar` are now hidden when the scroll bar's maximum scroll position is equal to its minimum scroll position, just like how the thumb is hidden. The track will be resized to fill the extra space where the buttons were previously rendered.

When replacing the `dataProvider` of a `List` or `GroupedList` (or replacing the `data` property of a `ListCollection` or `HierarchicalCollection`), it is no longer necessary to call `updateItemAt()` on the new collection if it contains some of the same items as the previous collection. This behavior will happen automatically.

## 1.3.1

* NumericStepper: fixed issue where using step to calculate a new value didn't account for the minimum value.
* NumericStepper: fixed issue where only some text was selected after changing value.

### 1.3.0 Deprecated APIs

All deprecated APIs are subject to the [Feathers deprecation policy](http://wiki.starling-framework.org/feathers/deprecation-policy). Please migrate to the new APIs as soon as possible because the deprecated APIs **will** be removed in a future version of Feathers.

The `scrollerProperties` property on scrolling components, including List, GroupedList, ScrollText and ScrollContainer was originally deprecated in Feathers 1.1.0, and it has now been removed. Because these components now extend `Scroller` instead of adding a `Scroller` as a child, all of the properties that could be set through `scrollerProperties` can now be set directly on the components.

### 1.3.0 API Changes

Some changes have been made to Feathers that have the potential to break code in existing projects. Changes of this type may be considered [exceptions to the Feathers deprecation policy](http://wiki.starling-framework.org/feathers/deprecation-policy#exceptions), and careful consideration is made to limit the impact of these changes on existing projects. Most developers using Feathers will not be affected by these changes, except perhaps, to observe improved stability and consistency.

#### ILayout

One change has been made to the `ILayout` interface. Custom implementations of `ILayout` created before Feathers 1.3.0 will have compiler errors until the required changes are made.

The property `requiresLayoutOnScroll` has been added to `ILayout` to provide improved performance for static layouts that don't change when a container scrolls.

 This property can easily simulate the old behavior from Feathers 1.2.0, if required. The following implementation of `requiresLayoutOnScroll` can easily be copied into a custom implementations of `ILayout` to quickly migrate existing Feathers 1.2.0 implementations to behave exactly the same in Feathers 1.3.0:

	public function get requiresLayoutOnScroll():Boolean
	{
		return true;
	}

### 1.2.0 Deprecated APIs

All deprecated APIs are subject to the [Feathers deprecation policy](http://wiki.starling-framework.org/feathers/deprecation-policy). Please migrate to the new APIs as soon as possible because the deprecated APIs **will** be removed in a future version of Feathers.

The `scrollerProperties` property on scrolling components, including List, GroupedList, ScrollText and ScrollContainer is deprecated. Because these components now extend `Scroller` instead of adding a `Scroller` as a child, all of the properties that could be set through `scrollerProperties` can now be set directly on the components. The `scrollerProperties` property was deprecated in Feathers 1.1.0, and it remains deprecated in Feathers 1.2.0. 

### 1.2.0 API Changes

Some changes have been made to Feathers that have the potential to break code in existing projects. Changes of this type are considered [exceptions to the Feathers deprecation policy](http://wiki.starling-framework.org/feathers/deprecation-policy#exceptions), and careful consideration is made to limit the impact of these changes on existing projects. Most developers using Feathers will not be affected by these changes, except perhaps, to observe improved stability and consistency.

#### PopUpManager

Two changes have been made to the `PopUpManager`.

The function `isTopLevelPopUp()` has been modified to indicate if a pop-up is above the top-most modal overlay. Previously, this function indicated if a pop-up is the single top-most pop-up.

When a pop-up is centered when calling `PopUpManager.addPopUp()`, the `PopUpManager` will automatically realign the pop-up if the stage or the pop-up is resized. If you prefer that the pop-up isn't realigned, change the argument to `false` and call `PopUpManager.centerPopUp()` instead. It will align the pop-up only once. If you previously manually repositioned the pop-up to keep it centered when it or the stage resized, you may remove that code. However, if the code remains, it should not cause conflicts with the new behavior.

#### IVirtualLayout

Three changes have been made to the `IVirtualLayout` interface. Custom implementations of `IVirtualLayout` created before Feathers 1.2.0 will have compiler errors until the required changes are made. It is expected that a small number of Feathers developers have created custom implementations of `IVirtualLayout`, so this change will have no impact on the majority of projects that are upgraded from older versions of Feathers.

The `typicalItemWidth` and `typicalItemHeight` properties may be removed completely from custom `IVirtualLayout` implementations. In their place, the `typicalItem` property must be added. Components like `List` previously passed pre-calculated width and height values for a typical item display object. However, a layout may need to manipulate the typical item before calculating its dimensions. By giving more control to the layouts, their estimation of virtualized items will be more accurate.

The new `typicalItem` property might be declared as follows:

	/**
	 * @private
	 */
	protected var _typicalItem:DisplayObject;

	/**
	 * @inheritDoc
	 */
	public function get typicalItem():DisplayObject
	{
		return this._typicalItem;
	}

	/**
	 * @private
	 */
	public function set typicalItem(value:DisplayObject):void
	{
		if(this._typicalItem == value)
		{
			return;
		}
		this._typicalItem = value;
		this.dispatchEventWith(Event.CHANGE);
	}

Usage of the new `typicalItem` property may depend on factors that are specific to each implementation. In general, an implementation will measure the typical item at the beginning of most of its public functions, including `layout()`, `getScrollPositionForIndex()`, `getVisibleIndicesAtScrollPosition()`, and `measureViewPort()`. If the typical item is a Feathers control, it should be validated. The following snippet shows the most basic case for how to request the typical item's dimensions:

	var measuredTypicalItemWidth:Number = 0;
	var measuredTypicalItemHeight:Number = 0;
	if( this._useVirtualLayout && this._typicalItem )
	{
		if( this._typicalItem is IFeathersControl )
		{
			//validate the typical item so that it reports the correct width and height
			this._typicalItem.validate();
		}

		measuredTypicalItemWidth = this._typicalItem.width;
		measuredTypicalItemHeight = this._typicalItem.height;
	}

If the typical item is a Feathers control, validate() should be called before requesting its dimensions. Optionally, the dimensions of a Feathers control may be reset to `NaN` in order to ask the control for its ideal dimensions. This will match the behavior introduced Feathers 1.1.x. However, in Feathers 1.2.0, the built-in layouts have chosen to reset the typical item's dimensions only when a flag is enabled. For many layouts, resetting the dimensions of the typical item is rarely required, and it may be undesireable. This change reverts the behavior to match Feathers 1.0.x, while still allowing advanced developers to re-enable the behavior introduced in Feathers 1.1.x.

For more advanced code, take a look at one of the built-in layout classes, such as `VerticalLayout`.

Note: The built-in layout classes repurpose the `typicalItemWidth` and `typicalItemHeight` properties that were removed from `IVirtualLayout` to work with a new `resetTypicalItemDimensionsOnMeasure` property. By default, setting these properties outside of a component like `List` will have no effect, which exactly matches the behavior from all older versions of Feathers. Custom layouts may elect to provide this same capability, but it is not required by the `IVirtualLayout` interface.

#### GroupedList

The `typicalHeader` and `typicalFooter` properties have been removed from `GroupedList` to support the better handling of typical items in virtual layouts, as discussed above. From now on, the `typicalItem` on a `GroupedList` is the only way to provide hints to the layout used by a `GroupedList`.

## 1.1.1

## 1.1.0

* New Beta Component: NumericStepper. Add and subtract from a numeric value with buttons. Optional text editing.
* New Beta Component: TextArea. A multiline text input. Recommended for desktop only. Not recommended for mobile.
* New Beta Component: Panel. A new container subclassing ScrollContainer that adds a header and an optional footer.
* New Beta Component: PanelScreen. An IScreen implementation (similar to Screen) based on Panel.
* New Beta Layout: AnchorLayout. Added to support fluid layouts and relative positioning. Can position relative to parent container and also to other children of the parent container.
* Added FocusManager for keyboard navigation and interaction. Not intended for mobile. Use a desktop theme or set `FocusManager.isEnabled = true`. TextInput *cannot* use StageTextTextEditor when focus management is enabled. TextFieldTextEditor is recommended.

* List: if items are added or removed, selected indices are adjusted.
* List, GroupedList, ScrollContainer, and ScrollText all extend Scroller, instead of using it as a sub-component. The scrollerProperties property on each of these is now deprecated because all public properties of Scroller are now direct public properties of these components. Theme initializers that target Scroller will break because Scroller is no longer a sub-component, but a super class of classes like List. Move this stuff into initializers for List, GroupedList, ScrollContainer, and ScrollText.
* FeathersControl: setSizeInternal() is now stricter. It can never receive a NaN value for width or height. This is a common source of bugs, and throwing an error here will help make it easier to find those bugs.
* IVariableVirtualLayout: added function addToVariableVirtualCacheAtIndex() for more specific control over the cache of item dimensions.
* IVariableVirtualLayout: added function removeFromVariableVirtualCacheAtIndex() for more specific control over the cache of item dimensions.

* Scroller: scrolling animates for mouse wheel.
* List, VerticalLayout, HorizontalLayout: optimized case where useVirtualLayout is true and hasVariableItemDimensions is false.
* HorizontalLayout, VerticalLayout, TiledRowsLayout, TiledColumnsLayout: added manageVisibility property to set items to false when not in view. Set to true to improve performance.
* Item Renderers: added stopScrollingOnAccessoryTouch property to make accessory touch behavior configurable.
* Screen: default value of originalDPI is DeviceCapabilities.dpi. It used to be 168. Can still be changed.
* MetalWorksMobileTheme and MinimalMobileTheme: major overhaul with improved skins and new alternate skins.
* AeonDesktopTheme: added some missing skins, like TabBar.

* Todos: new example.
* All Examples: Use PanelScreen instead of Screen and Header where appropriate.
* All Examples: Use AnchorLayout where appropriate.
* All Examples: Uses NumericStepper instead of Slider where appropriate.
* Added 96x96 icons to examples for Android xhdpi. Requires AIR 3.7.
* Extended API documentation with inline examples and improved descriptions.
* Added many new articles to the Feathers Manual.
* Now built with ASC 2.0.

### 1.1.0 Deprecated APIs

All deprecated APIs are subject to the [Feathers deprecation policy](http://wiki.starling-framework.org/feathers/deprecation-policy). Please migrate to the new APIs as soon as possible because the deprecated APIs **will** be removed in a future version of Feathers.

The `scrollerProperties` property on scrolling components, including List, GroupedList, ScrollText and ScrollContainer is deprecated. Because these components now extend `Scroller` instead of adding a `Scroller` as a child, all of the properties that could be set through `scrollerProperties` can now be set directly on the components.

### 1.1.0 API Changes

Some changes have been made to Feathers that have the potential to break code in existing projects. Changes of this type are considered [exceptions to the Feathers deprecation policy](http://wiki.starling-framework.org/feathers/deprecation-policy#exceptions), and careful consideration is made to limit the impact of these changes on existing projects. Most developers using Feathers will not be affected by these changes, except perhaps, to observe improved stability and consistency.

#### IVariableVirtualLayout

Two changes have been made to the `IVariableVirtualLayout` interface. Custom implementations of `IVariableVirtualLayout` created before Feathers 1.1.0 will have compiler errors until the required changes are made. It is expected that a very small number of Feathers developers have created custom implementations of `IVariableVirtualLayout`, so this change will have no impact on the vast majority of projects that are upgraded from older versions of Feathers.

The functions `addToVariableVirtualCacheAtIndex()` and `removeFromVariableVirtualCacheAtIndex()` have been added to `IVariableVirtualLayout` to provide lower-level control over the cache of item dimensions. Instead of clearing the entire cache, a component may insert or remove a specific index from the cache. For instance, the `List` component uses these functions when its data provider is manipulated. These functions allow the layout to provide more accuracy to its virtualization and to improve performance.

 These two functions can easily simulate the old behavior from Feathers 1.0.x, if required. The following implementations of `addToVariableVirtualCacheAtIndex()` and `removeFromVariableVirtualCacheAtIndex()` can easily be copied into a custom implementations of `IVariableVirtualLayout` to quickly migrate existing Feathers 1.0.x implementations to behave exactly the same in Feathers 1.1.0:

	public function addToVariableVirtualCacheAtIndex(index:int, item:DisplayObject = null):void
	{
		this.resetVariableVirtualCache();
	}

	public function removeFromVariableVirtualCacheAtIndex(index:int, item:DisplayObject = null):void
	{
		this.resetVariableVirtualCache();
	}

## 1.0.1

This release includes a number of bug fixes.

* Scroller: FeathersEventType.SCROLL_COMPLETE always dispatched after last Event.SCROLL.
* ScrollBar, SimpleScrollBar: thumb position properly accounts for padding.
* Scroller: mouse wheel detection properly accounts for contentScaleFactor.
* ScreenNavigator: calling clearScreen() during a transition no longer causes a stack overflow.
* ScrollBar, SimpleScrollBar: can drag to minimum and maximum if they aren't a multiple of the step.
* Header: Fix for runtime error when rightItems aren't IFeathersDisplayObjects
* TextInput: better selection/cursor recovery when changing text programmatically.
* TextInput: Moved fontSize contentScaleFactor multiplication into StageTextTextEditor.
* FeathersControl: requires isInitialized to be true before it can validate.
* FeathersControl: clipRect properly accounts for scale.
* GroupedList: added missing documentation for setSelectedLocation().
* ImageLoader: does a better job keeping aspect ratio when only one dimension is explicit.
* ImageLoader: properly scales content when dimensions are explicit.
* ImageLoader: no runtime errors if content loads after dispose.
* ScrollContainer, List, GroupedList, ScrollText: fix for detecting changes in scrollToPageIndex().

## 1.0.0

No major API changes since 1.0.0 BETA. Mostly bug fixes and minor improvements.

* Fix for memory leaks in List, GroupedList, and ImageLoader
* PageIndicator properly handles ImageLoader or other IFeathersControl as symbol
* IGroupedListHeaderOrFooterRenderer extends IFeathersControl
* Header: fix for "middle" vertical alignment
* Updated for Starling Framework 1.3

## 1.0.0 BETA

Initial release. The following major changes happened in the last month or two leading to the beta.

* GTween library removed as a dependency. All animations switched to the Starling `Tween` class.
* as3-signals library removed as a dependency. Switched to Starling events.
* `TextInput`: supports swappable text editors, similar to the text renderers used for uneditable text. The default `StageTextTextEditor` uses `StageText` to allow text input, which is ideal for mobile. The `TextFieldTextEditor` uses a `TextField` of `TextFieldType.INPUT` instead, and it may be a better choice for desktop. A static function, `defaultTextEditorFactory`, has been added to `FeathersControl`.
* `TextInput`: now has events for focus in and out.
* Item renderers: Switched to `ImageLoader` for icon and accessory textures, which has a `source` property that supports `Texture` instances or `String` URLs to load textures from the web. Properties like `iconTextureField` and `accessoryTextureFunction` now have new names like `iconSourceField` and `accessorySourceFunction` because values other than textures are now allowed. Similarly, `iconImageFactory` and `accessoryImageFactory` have been renamed to `iconLoaderFactory` and `accessoryLoaderFactory`.
* Item renderers: accessory may be positioned. See `layoutOrder` and `accessoryPosition` properties.
* Added `dispose()` method to `AddedWatcher` so that theme resources like textures be disposed.
* Added `ScrollText` component to display text in an overlay on the native display list. Useful for long passages of text that may be too large to convert to a texture.
* `ScreenNavigator`: added events for transition start and complete.
* `ToggleSwitch`: `TRACK_LAYOUT_MODE_STRETCH` is now `TRACK_LAYOUT_MODE_ON_OFF`.
* `Slider`: `TRACK_LAYOUT_MODE_STRETCH` is now `TRACK_LAYOUT_MODE_MIN_MAX`.
* `ScrollBar`: `TRACK_LAYOUT_MODE_STRETCH` is now `TRACK_LAYOUT_MODE_MIN_MAX`.
